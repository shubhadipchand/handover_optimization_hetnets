#Handover Optimization in 5g Heterogeneous Networks using Deep Q Networks#

This project implements a handover optimization scheme in 5g heterogeneous networks (small cell readius networks eg. microcells, picocells, femtocells etc) using Deep Q Networks 
& then compared with traditional handover algorithms like the a3 handover. The DQN agent after training gives a positive results proving the efficiency of the DQN algorithm over the A3 handover.
